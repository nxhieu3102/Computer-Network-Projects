;Duds,All but about 4 were duds. What a waste of money.
;Five Stars,Came in a compact box and work just as well as leading brands
;For what they are, great buy!,It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great.
;Worst Battery We've Ever Used!!!!!,Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer. I literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an Amazon AAA battery 2 days ago and its already out. We have to replace everything that has an Amazon battery constantly. Will not buy these again.

;Stick with a name brand in your camera.,These do not work good in cameras. I use a small point and shoot Cannon Camera for work. With these batteries I seem to be changing them almost every time I go out. Other name brand batteries seem to last 3-4 time longer.

;One Star,batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month
;Good value price for very good batteries!,Good buy - these batteries work as good as all the other brands I've purchased!
;Great for small electronics,Decent longevity in electronics we use daily. In remotes they're fabulous, less so in more demanding electronics like games, cameras, and the half dozen Thomas trains my son loves. For the price in comparison to Duracell or Energizer you can't go wrong.
