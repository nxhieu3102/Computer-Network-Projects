;Five Stars - good deal
;nice pack with under cabinet lighting - would buy again.
;Fantastic! - These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive.
;Batteries are high quality and surprisingly powerful. - I used these batteries in a Canon 420 Speedflash. Normally, under multiple exposure (around 3 shots per second), using standard alkaline I'd get 3 continuous flashes before a miss, or with fancy High Discharge Rate Flash batteries (translate - Expensive!), I'd get 5-6 continuous flashes. The last photography shoot, I was asked to get back-to-back images of a person at a surprise Birthday Party. Imagine my surprise when, upon entry of the victim, I captured 9 continuous exposures with perfect flash! I am very impressed!These batteries are high quality and surprisingly powerful!
;They're batteries at a great price. Simple enough - AmazonBasics batteries are definitely the way to go. Or at least if you need AA or AAA batteries (the 9v batteries aren't that great). You get a higher quantity for less the price compared to going to Target. And for what it's worth, I really like the simplicity of the packaging.
