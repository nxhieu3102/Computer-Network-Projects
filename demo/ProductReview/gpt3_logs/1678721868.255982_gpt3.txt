==========

The Amazon Tap is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa, allowing users to stream Spotify, Pandora, and ESPN Radio. It has great sound quality and is very portable, with an 8 hour battery life and a charging stand that is simple to use. It is well worth the price and is perfect for the office or taking on the go. However, it does require hands on to operate and is not as loud as some would like at high volumes. Additionally, it is only useful if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system.
