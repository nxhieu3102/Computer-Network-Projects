Recommended. - Product works as advertised, no issues. Recommended.
;surely worth the cost, but might last a little less than other big brands. - can't beat the price, but i could sweat my energizers last a little longer. i'll shoot from the hip here: i think the dollars/output is better than energizers, but if battery life is the only real variable i might go with commercial battery brands. please note- this is not carefully measures, just first glance based on kids playing with toys...
