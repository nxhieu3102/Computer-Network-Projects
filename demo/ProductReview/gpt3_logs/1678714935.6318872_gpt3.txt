Summarize the following product reviews as a paragraph of key strengths, weaknesses, and improvements.


Great sound - This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.
-Great add-on to echo! - I added to a "dot" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!
-Great product - Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.
-Great sound for a small speaker - I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!
-Nice addition for Echo owners - Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities.
-Awesome smart device - This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.
-Great for portability. - The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?
-OK - The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!
-Not what I thought - You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.
-Alexa works good, but... - Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.
-i enjoy using this speaker at work, & at home - It has sleep timer capability alarm I use it at work, or use it at home while I'm in the shower and I'll bring it to Friends houses and we use Alexa to gain information or just have fun. quality a 9 its loud too.
-Much more then a speaker - This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.
-Its loud and has a good battery - It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.
-Excellent gadget - I love that this works just like the dot, which I already have 3. However in addition it is portable and has better speaker
-Great - I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to
-Great assistant - I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day.
-Very decent sound and the portability is excellent - The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.
-Awesome device w/ Alexa features. - Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you.
-Great Product! - I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!
-Nice addition to the echo lineup - I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!
-Great item for a beginner - This is a great buy for music, news and any kind of information you want.
-Music on the go - It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.
-Disappointed with Coverage - We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.
-Love the Tap - Really like the Wi Fi & being able to take it to any room in the house. My music sounds great. Love all the features.
-Tap - It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.


Paragraph of all key strengths, weaknesses, and improvments for this product:


==========

The Amazon Tap is a great addition to the Echo lineup, offering portability and a rechargeable battery. It has great sound quality for a small speaker and is a great gift for those who have everything. It is also a great assistant for keeping up with the news and weather. However, it does not have sound activation and the coverage can be spotty. Additionally, it requires an Amazon Prime account and a special music plan. Improvements could include sound activation and better coverage.
