USER: hello, remind to study philosophy tomorrow

RAVEN: Hello USER! It's great to hear from you. It sounds like you need a reminder to study philosophy tomorrow. To ensure that you don't forget, why not set a reminder on your phone or computer? That way, you'll get a notification when it's time to start studying. Do you think this is a good idea?

USER: can you do it for me?

RAVEN: Sure, I can help you set a reminder for tomorrow. I can send you a notification at a specific time, or I can send you a daily reminder. What would you prefer? Additionally, do you have any other tasks or goals that you would like me to help you with?
